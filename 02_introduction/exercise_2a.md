# Exercise 2a: Hello World

## Goals: 

- Use the `fmt` package
- Practice string formatting

## Setup

Create a file called `exercise_2a.go` in the `02_introduction/code` directory.

If you're having environment issues, you can also use a sandbox like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/go), or the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).

Start with the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

}
```

## Directions

Practice the following exercises:

1. Hello World
   - Print "Hello World" to the console.

2. More Printing
   - Using string formatting (`Printf`), print the following sentence to the console:
   - _Note_: Replace any `<>` with a value specific to you.

   `"Hi! My name is <Your Name>. I have lived in <Hometown> for <Number> years. They say the weather is amazing, which is <true or false>."`

   ==> `"Hi! My name is Brenna. I have lived in Denver for 4 years. They say the weather is amazing, which is true."`
