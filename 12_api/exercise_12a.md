# Exercise 12A: Hit an External API

## Goals

- Practice creating http routes and handlers with external API endpoints

## Setup

- Create a file called `exercise_12a.go` in the `12_api/code` directory.

- Feel free to copy the template from `11_server/code/api.go` as a starting place.

## Directions

- This will be a code-along type of exercise so instructions will be verbal as we work through the examples.
