# Exercise 4b: Refactoring Functions

## Goals

- Practice variadic functions
- Practice and review managing types

## Setup

- Feel free to refactor the code from `exercise_4a.go`, or create a new file called `exercise_4b.go` in the same directory.

## Directions

1. Refactor your code to use a variadic function that takes in an unknown number of arguments. 

## Hints

_HINT_: To find the length of a collection, use `len(someCollection)`.

_HINT_: Check the type of `len(someCollection)`
