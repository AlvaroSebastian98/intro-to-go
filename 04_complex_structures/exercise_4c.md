# Exercise 4c: Functions, Arrays, Slices, Maps,

## Goals

- Practice working with arrays, slices, and maps
- Review `range`

## Setup

- Create a file called `exercise_4c.go` in the `04_complex_structures/code` directory.

## Directions

### Part 1

1. Instantiate an array of scores 
    - The array should have at least 5 elements of type `float64`

2. Write a function that calculates and returns the average score (also a float)
    - Use the `range` keyword


### Part 2

1. Define a map that contains a set of pet names, and their corresponding animal type. i.e.: `"fido": "dog"`.

2. Write a function that takes a string argument and returns a boolean indicating whether or not that key exists in your map of pets. 


### Part 3

1. Instantiate a slice that has an initial value of a collection of groceries. 

2. Write a function that takes one or more groceries as strings and appends them to the slice, printing out the resulting list of groceries.
