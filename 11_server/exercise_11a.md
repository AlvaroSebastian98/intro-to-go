# Exercise 11A: Build A Web Server

## Goals

- Practice creating http routes and handlers

## Setup

- Create a file called `exercise_11a.go` in the `11_server/code` directory.

- Feel free to copy the template from `11_server/code/server.go` as a starting place.

## Directions

- This will be a code-along type of exercise so instructions will be verbal as we work through the examples.
