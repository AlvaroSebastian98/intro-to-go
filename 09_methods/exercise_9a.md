# Exercise 9: Methods

## Goals

- Practice writing a method 

## Setup

- Revisit the Structs lesson (`06_structs/structs.md`) and use the `06_structs/exercise_6a.md` exercise for reference.

- Copy the code from the solution of `06_structs/exercise_6a` into a new file called `exercise_9a.go` as a starting point.

## Directions

1. Refactor the `describeUser` code to be a method (this should be a repetition of what was just completed in the course).

2. Modify the `describeGroup` function to be a method called `describe()` that receives a `Group` type.

3. Modify the main function to reflect those changes
