# Exercise 6A: Structs 

## Goals

- Work with structs

## Setup

- Reference the code discussed in `structs.md` and `code/structs.go`

- Let's say that in `describeGroup`, we only want to accept new users (represented by the `spaceAvailable` field) if there are fewer than 2 existing users in the group.

## Directions

1. In the `describeGroup`, update `spaceAvailable` to be `false` if there are 2 or more users.

2. Reprint the variable `g` at the end of `main()`. What do you notice?
