# Exercise 3a: Control Structures

## Goals: 

- Practice setting up a basic Go file
- Declaring variables
- Iterating over a collection using a for loop and the range keyword
- Using if statements
- Troubleshooting using covered topics

## Directions

1. Create a file called `exercise_3a.go` in the `03_ctrl_structures/code` directory.

2. In your `main` function, declare a variable that has a value of a sentence.

3. Iterate over that sentence using `range`.

4. If the index of that letter is an odd number, print that letter.

5. What do you notice?

## Hints

_Hint_: You might need to convert a type to get the output you expect

_Hint_: The modulo operator in Go functions similarly to
JavaScript.
